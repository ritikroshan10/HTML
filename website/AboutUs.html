					When discussing achievements in life, it's essential to be specific, focusing on the skills and experiences that are relevant to the context.
					Using the STAR method ( Situation, Task, Action, Result) can be helpful in structuring a response to questions about achievements. Ultimately,
					achievements in life are a personal and subjective concept, and what constitutes an achievement can vary greatly from person to person.</p>
